## Fun with BASIC!

![1 Potato 2 Potato](https://i.imgur.com/O0Pjufi.gif)

Sometimes for pleasure I write audio programs in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) on my [TRS-80 Model 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Model_100).

Some may end up in use for recording purposes, some not - but in the end it's just a zen thing really.


### Don't have an old machine with a BASIC interpreter lying around? *No problem!*

Here's a couple useful tools to help satisfy all your BASIC needs.

#### MS-QBASIC Interpreter emulator
* [Archive.org](https://archive.org/)'s [MS-DOS Archive](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_msdos) has a live
[Microsoft QBasic 1.1](https://archive.org/details/msdos_qbasic_megapack) emulation available where you can
write programs in [MS BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_BASIC) syntax.

#### Chipmunk BASIC
Want to actully save your `.BAS` files and run them in a local interpreter? [Chipmunk Basic](http://www.nicholson.com/rhn/basic/) makes this easy.
* Grab the [MacOS Beta download](http://www.nicholson.com/rhn/basic/).
* Add it's executable to the appropriate `/bin` directory to get it in your execution $path.
* Plug away with commands like `$ basic filename.bas` (reference the README provided in the download bundle to do this correctly).
* Skim the Chipmunk BASIC [Reference Manual](http://www.nicholson.com/rhn/basic/basic.man.html) for syntax, etc.

#### MS-BASIC Interpreter for Macintosh
What about Archive.org's emulation of the [MS BASIC 1.0 Interpreter for Macintosh](https://archive.org/details/mac_MSBASIC_1) you might ask. 
Well, it currently appears that it and most programs in the [Macintosh Software Archive](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_mac)
are not able to receive the '-' character from my keyboard, so I can't recommend using them.
