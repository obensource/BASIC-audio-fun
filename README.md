## Fun with BASIC!

Sometimes for pleasure I write audio programs in BASIC on my TRS-80 Model 100.

Some may end up in use for recording purposes, some not - but in the end it's just a zen thing really.


### Don't have an old machine with a BASIC interpreter lying around? No problem!

#### MS-QBASIC Interpreter emulator
[Archive.org](https://archive.org/)'s [MS-DOS Archive](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_msdos) has a live
[Microsoft QBasic 1.1](https://archive.org/details/msdos_qbasic_megapack) emulation available where you can
write programs in [MS BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_BASIC) syntax.

#### MS-BASIC Interpreter for Macintosh
What about Archive.org's emulation of the [MS BASIC 1.0 Interpreter for Macintosh](https://archive.org/details/mac_MSBASIC_1) you might ask. 
Well, it currently appears that it and most programs in the [Macintosh Software Archive](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_mac)
are not able to receive the '-' character from my keyboard, so I can't recommend using them.

#### Chipmunk BASIC
Looking to actully save your `.BAS` files and run them in a local interpreter? [Chipmunk Basic](http://www.nicholson.com/rhn/basic/) makes this easy.
Just grab the [MacOS Beta download](http://www.nicholson.com/rhn/basic/), add it's executable to the appropriate `/bin` directory to get it in
your execution $path - and plug away with commands like `$ basic filename.bas`. (Reference the README provided in the download bundle to do this correctly)
